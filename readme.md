  - setting up nodemon to our app
  - Install express (npm install express --save)
  - Import Express to our app
  - Setting up Local Port Server

  - Connect our App With Atlas DB and Compas Localy GUI
  - Setting Up our App with Localy MongoDB Document

* **Refactoring API Route**

  - Refactor File for express Route
